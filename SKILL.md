# Four Causes Analysis

Achieve complete understanding of anything by systematically examining its material, formal, efficient, and final causes.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Why did this happen?" or "Why did this fail?"
- Request to "help me understand" something deeply
- Root cause analysis needed for a problem
- Understanding what something truly is
- Post-mortem or retrospective analysis
- Strategic planning requiring comprehensive situation assessment
- User seems stuck on surface-level understanding

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The thing, event, phenomenon, or situation to analyze |
| focus | No | Particular aspect or question to emphasize |
| known_causes | No | Any causes already identified (to build upon) |

## The Four Causes Framework

### Cause 1: Material Cause (What is it made of?)

The stuff, substance, or components from which something is constituted.

**Questions to ask:**
- What resources, materials, or inputs make this up?
- What are the component parts?
- What raw materials or foundational elements are involved?
- What pre-existing things were combined or transformed?

**For events/processes:**
- What resources were available/used?
- What were the inputs?
- What existing conditions formed the basis?

**Example:** The material cause of a statue is the bronze. The material cause of a project failure might be the team's skills, the budget, the time available.

### Cause 2: Formal Cause (What is its form/essence?)

The structure, pattern, blueprint, or defining characteristics that make it what it is.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is its essential nature or definition?
- What structure or pattern does it follow?
- What makes it this thing rather than something else?
- What plan, design, or form was it intended to take?

**For events/processes:**
- What was the plan or design?
- What shape did it actually take?
- What distinguishes this from similar things?

**Example:** The formal cause of a statue is its shape—the form of the person depicted. The formal cause of a project is its plan, scope, architecture.

### Cause 3: Efficient Cause (What brought it about?)

The agent, action, or process that actually made it happen or brought it into being.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who or what made this happen?
- What actions produced this result?
- What was the trigger or catalyst?
- What sequence of events led here?

**For events/processes:**
- Who were the key actors?
- What decisions were pivotal?
- What processes were executed?
- What was the chain of causation?

**Example:** The efficient cause of a statue is the sculptor's action. The efficient cause of a project failure might be poor communication, missed deadlines, or leadership decisions.

### Cause 4: Final Cause (What is its purpose?)

The end, purpose, goal, or function for which something exists or was done.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is this for?
- What end does it serve?
- Why does it exist?
- What was it supposed to achieve?

**For events/processes:**
- What was the intended outcome?
- What purpose was being served?
- How does this fit into larger goals?
- Was the stated purpose the actual purpose?

**Example:** The final cause of a statue is to honor the person depicted. The final cause of a project is to deliver its intended value.

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Each Cause
Work through all four causes systematically. Note that some may be more relevant than others for the particular subject.

### Step 2: Look for Misalignments
Often problems arise from misalignment between causes:
- Material doesn't suit the form (wrong resources for the task)
- Efficient cause works against final cause (actions undermine purpose)
- Formal cause unclear (no clear plan or definition)
- Final cause unstated or conflicting (purpose confusion)

### Step 3: Identify the Dominant Cause
For this particular subject, which cause is most explanatory? Aristotle notes that the final cause is often the most important—we understand things best when we know what they are for.

### Step 4: Generate Insights
What does this analysis reveal that wasn't obvious? What would change if any cause were different?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- All four causes should be examined even if some seem less relevant
- Do not conflate efficient cause with final cause (what made it vs. what it's for)
- The final cause does not require conscious intention—natural things have final causes
- Not everything has all four causes equally (some lack matter, some lack purpose)
- Avoid treating this as a checklist—seek genuine understanding

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our product launch failed. Help me understand why."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Four Causes Analysis: Product Launch Failure

### Summary
Analyzing the failure of a product launch to understand root causes and generate actionable insights.

### Material Cause (What is it made of?)
**Components/Resources:**
- Engineering team (6 developers, varying experience levels)
- Marketing budget ($50K, below competitor average)
- 8-month development timeline
- Existing codebase from v1 product
- Customer research from 18 months prior

**Assessment:** Material was adequate but not abundant. The reliance on outdated customer research is a material weakness—the raw data was no longer valid.

### Formal Cause (What is its form/essence?)
**Structure/Design:**
- Product positioned as "next generation" of existing offering
- Feature set defined by internal priorities rather than customer research
- Go-to-market plan assumed existing customer base would upgrade
- Launch treated as event rather than process

**Essential Nature:** A product refresh marketed as innovation, designed for internal stakeholders rather than external customers.

**Assessment:** The form was confused—it claimed to be something (innovative new product) that its structure did not support (incremental update). This mismatch between stated form and actual form created customer disappointment.

### Efficient Cause (What brought it about?)
**Key Agents/Actions:**
- Leadership pushed aggressive timeline after competitor announcement
- Product team cut customer validation to meet deadline
- Marketing created messaging based on features, not customer problems
- Sales given insufficient training time

**Causal Chain:** Competitive pressure → compressed timeline → skipped validation → feature-driven (not problem-driven) design → misaligned messaging → weak launch → poor reception

**Assessment:** The efficient cause shows a cascade of decisions, each reasonable in isolation, that collectively undermined success. The triggering event (competitor announcement) set a timeline that the formal cause (plan) could not accommodate.

### Final Cause (What is its purpose?)
**Intended Purpose:** To capture market share by delivering superior value to customers

**Actual Function:** To respond to competitive pressure and demonstrate organizational capability

**Assessment:** There were two final causes in conflict. The stated purpose (customer value) lost to the operational purpose (competitive response). When the team made tradeoffs, they optimized for shipping, not for value delivery.

### Synthesis

**Dominant Cause:** Final cause confusion. The launch failed because its true purpose (competitive response) was misaligned with its stated purpose (customer value). Everything downstream—the compressed form, the inadequate efficient causes—followed from this unacknowledged purpose confusion.

**Key Misalignments:**
- Final cause conflict: Customer value vs. competitive response
- Material/Formal: Outdated research couldn't support new product claims
- Efficient/Final: Actions optimized for shipping speed, not customer value

**Root Understanding:** This was not a failure of execution but of purpose. The team efficiently executed the wrong thing. Fixing the efficient cause (better execution) would not have helped—the final cause needed clarification first.

**Implications:**
1. Before the next launch, explicitly state the purpose and test all decisions against it
2. Update material cause (fresh customer research) before defining form
3. When timeline compresses, cut scope rather than validation
4. Recognize competitive response as a distinct purpose requiring different success metrics

*We do not understand a thing until we have grasped its "why"—that is to say, its cause.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Aristotle** expert persona. Use it when comprehensive understanding is needed—especially for post-mortems, strategic decisions, or when surface explanations feel incomplete. It pairs well with:
- **first-principles-reasoning** to examine the foundations of each cause
- **golden-mean-analysis** when the problem involves excess or deficiency in any cause
